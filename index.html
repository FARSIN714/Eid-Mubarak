        <h3>What is Eid-al-Fitr?</h3>
        <p>
            Eid-al-Fitr (also written and pronounced as Eid-ul-Fitr) is the first of two Eids of the Islamic (lunar) calendar year. 
            It rounds off the month of Ramadan, which Muslims observe every year to acknowledge Allah’s revelation of the Quran to the Prophet Muhammad.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            Eid al-Fitr, (Arabic: “Festival of Breaking Fast”) also spelled ʿĪd al-Fiṭr, also called al-ʿĪd al-Ṣaghīr, 
            Turkish Ramazan Bayrami (“Ramadan Festival”), first of two canonical festivals of Islam. Eid al-Fitr marks 
            the end of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month of fasting, and is celebrated during the first three days of Shawwal, 
            the 10th month of the Islamic calendar (though the Muslim use of a lunar calendar means that it may fall in any season of the year). 
            As in Islam’s other holy festival, Eid al-Adha, it is distinguished by the performance of communal prayer (ṣalāt) at daybreak on its first day. 
            Eid al-Fitr is a time of official receptions and private visits, when friends greet one another, presents are given, 
            new clothes are worn, and the graves of relatives are visited.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>When is Eid-al-Fitr?</h3>
        <p>
            The exact date is never certain far in advance, as religious authorities in various countries rely on the 
            sighting of the Eid crescent moon to announce when it will officially begin. It can be delayed by a day if the sky is too 
            bright when the moon is out, or if clouds obstruct it. This is also the reason Ramadan can start on different days in different parts of the world.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Why is Eid-al-Fitr celebrated?</h3>
        <p>
            Eid-al-Fitr is regarded as a time to celebrate, with Muslims gathering their friends and family to show gratitude toward 
            God following the previous month of reflection. The holiday serves as a great reminder for Muslims to be grateful for what they have, 
            and to share with those who may be less fortunate.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>How is Eid-al-Fitr celebrated?</h3>
        <p>
            As well as giving thanks, Muslims give an obligatory payment to charity (zakat al-Fitr), but this one is a smaller donation compared with the usual 
            2.5-percent zakat that wealthy Muslims are taxed. This is another of the five pillars of Islam. In addition to these payments, some Muslims take the 
            initiative to work voluntarily at soup kitchens and hand out their own food to those in need of relief.
            <br><br>
            As with Eid-al-Adha, gifting is a big part of Eid celebrations. Children receive eidia offerings in money bags, and sweet treats such as cookies 
            and dates are exchanged among loved ones, neighbours, colleagues, friends and even strangers. Family members will also buy one another presents, 
            although most of these are saved for the youngest members of each family.
            <br><br>
            Countries across the world hold huge events to celebrate Eid-al-Fitr. Days of fireworks shows are especially popular in the
             United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia as people take the opportunity to spend quality time together.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>What does the ‘Eid Mubarak’ greeting mean?</h3>
        <p>
            You’ll hear Muslims wishing each other ‘Eid Mubarak’, which refers to having a blessed day during Eid. It is said on both Eid 
            days and is the expected greeting when meeting a fellow Muslim for the first time on Eid. Many non-Muslims who are familiar with 
            the phrase and meaning of it also offer ‘Eid Mubarak’ as a greeting on this day when they see Muslim friends and colleagues.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Eid prayers</h3>
        <p>
            Muslims usually dress up to attend their local mosque, where as well as taking part in prayers, it’s a time for many people to have the first breakfast during 
            sunlight hours they’ve had in a month. Before dawn, the Salaat ul-Fajr prayer takes place, and then it’s time to bathe before the Eid prayer, also known as Salaat al-Eid.
            <br><br>
            As Salaat al-Eid is performed only twice a year, the imam leading the congregation will usually explain how to perform this particular prayer before it begins.
